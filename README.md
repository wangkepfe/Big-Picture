# Computer-Vision-Project-2
### final project for UCSC CMPE264 Computer Vision 17 Fall
1. Camera Calibration
   * Chestboard corners detection
   * Calibration: find camera intrinsic matrix and distortion factor
   * Image undistortion process
2. Homography
   * find homographies bwtween each images
   * calculate chain-multiplication of homographies
   * warp images into first image's camera perspective
   * merge images into one big image
3. Image Rotation
   * rotate the image by a homography
